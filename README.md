# Theory of Primordial Harmony

## Overview
The Theory of Primordial Harmony seeks to unify classical and quantum mechanics under a fundamental cosmic frequency, proposing a new framework to understand the interconnectedness of the universe. This repository serves as a central hub for the collaborative development, documentation, and exploration of this groundbreaking theory.

## Objective
Our goal is to investigate and refine the Theory of Primordial Harmony, integrating mathematical models, computational simulations, and empirical research to explore the universal frequency that governs the dynamics of the cosmos from the smallest quantum scales to the vast structures of the universe.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions from physicists, mathematicians, cosmologists, and thinkers from various disciplines who are intrigued by the potential of a unified cosmic harmony. Whether through theoretical development, simulation modeling, or observational analysis, your insights are valuable to the evolution of this theory.
